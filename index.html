            First, you'll preheat the oven, grease a 9x13 pan and gather all of your
            ingredients.Then, in a mixing bowl, you'll whisk the cocoa powder and
            melted butter. This will help disperse any clumps of cocoa. Then, you'll
            pour the hot water (or coffee) over the cocoa/butter mixture and whisk
            until well-combined. What's the purpose of the hot water, We'll get to

            batter into the prepared pan and top with pieces of the high quality
            chocolate bar and bake!

           </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
            Add all the marinade ingredients to a bowl and mix until fully combined,
            set aside.Slice a full-size chicken wing into three parts along the joints.
            Discard the wing-tip (or you can save them for making a chicken stock).
            For the drummet (the upper, meaty, one-bone part of the wing), cut along the
            circumference of the thin end so that the bone and the meat are no longer 
            connected. Then push down the meat so the drummet becomes a lollipop.</p>
            <p>
        For the winglet (the middle, two-bone part of the wing), separate where the two bones 
            join, and also cut along the circumferences of both ends, so the bone and the
            meat are no longer connected. Take out the thinner bone, and push down the
            meat into one end of the thinner bone.Place the prepared chicken lollipops in 
            the marinade. Stir and cover. Marinate in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
            Mix all batter ingredients until smooth without lumps. Dip the meat end of
            the chicken lollipops into the batter.In a medium-sized pot, heat the oil to
            170˚C (340˚F). Deep fry the chicken for 5 minutes or until the batter 
            becomes golden brown and the chicken is cooked throughout.
